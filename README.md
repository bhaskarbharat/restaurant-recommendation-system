# Restaurant-Recommendation-System

## Problem Statement
In this project, we created a recommendation system for restaurants using collaborative filtering (CF). We used the Yelp Dataset for this. 

The general structure of a recommendation system is that there are users and there are items. Users express explicit or implicit preferences towards certain items.

The data: https://www.yelp.com/dataset

Please read about the dataset here: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main
